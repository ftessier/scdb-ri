## Overview

The **Simulation Comparison Database (SCDB)** provides a systematic framework for verifying Monte Carlo radiation transport software through rigorous inter-comparisons, modelled after the BIPM Key Comparison Database (KCDB). This SCDB-RI repository pertains to Monte Carlo simulations for ionizing radiation (RI, for *Rayonnement Ionisant*).

Just as the KCDB establishes equivalence between measurement standards maintained by National Metrology Institutes (NMIs), the SCDB establishes equivalence between simulation results produced by different Monte Carlo software, creating a traceable foundation for computational ionizing radiation transport.

## The problem

Monte Carlo simulations are essential for radiation dosimetry, treatment planning, industrial radiation processing, and radiation protection. Yet unlike experimental measurements, simulations lack:

- **Systematic software comparisons** with quantified degrees of equivalence
- **Reference values** calculated from first principles
- **Certified simulation capabilities** analogous to Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs)
- **Public database** of validated simulation accuracy and efficiency
- **Traceability chain** to verified simulation results

Current practice relies on ad-hoc literature comparisons and uncoordinated validation studies. Each research group validates independently, making results difficult to compare and trust difficult to establish.

## The solution

SCDB implements the KCDB model for simulations:
