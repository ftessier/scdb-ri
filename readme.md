## Overview

The **Simulation Comparison Database (SCDB)** provides a systematic framework for validating Monte Carlo radiation transport codes through rigorous inter-code comparisons, modeled after the BIPM Key Comparison Database (KCDB).

Just as the KCDB establishes equivalence between measurement standards maintained by National Metrology Institutes (NMIs), the SCDB establishes equivalence between simulation results produced by different Monte Carlo software, creating a traceable foundation for computational ionizing radiation transport research.

## The problem

Monte Carlo simulations are essential for radiation dosimetry, treatment planning, industrial radiation processing, and radiation protection. Yet unlike experimental measurements, simulations lack:

- **Systematic software comparisons** with quantified degrees of equivalence
- **Reference values** calculated from first principles
- **Certified simulation capabilities** analogous to Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs)
- **Public database** of validated simulation accuracy and efficiency
- **Traceability chain** from simulation results to fundamental physics data

Current practice relies on ad-hoc literature comparisons and uncoordinated validation studies. Each research group validates independently, making results difficult to compare and trust difficult to establish.

## The solution

SCDB implements the KCDB model for simulations:
